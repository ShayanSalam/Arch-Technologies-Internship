# Machine Learning Internship Tasks 

This repository contains my completed tasks for the Machine Learning Internship offered by **ARCH Technologies**.  
The tasks demonstrate the use of **Supervised Learning** techniques for real-world applications using Python and its powerful ML libraries.

## Projects Included

## Task 1: Email Spam Classification
- Built a text classification model using:
  - TF-IDF vectorization
  - Multinomial Naive Bayes
  - Performance evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- Goal: Detect whether an email is spam or not based on its content.

## Task 2: MNIST Digit Recognition
- Developed a CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras to recognize handwritten digits (0â€“9).
- Implemented:
  - Model training and evaluation on MNIST dataset
  - Real-time digit prediction with OpenCV/Tkinter GUI

## Tools & Technologies
- Python, NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn
- TensorFlow, Keras
- OpenCV, Tkinter, Streamlit

# Machine Learning Internship Tasks 

This repository contains my completed tasks for the Machine Learning Internship offered by **ARCH Technologies**.  
The tasks demonstrate the use of **Supervised Learning** techniques for real-world applications using Python and its powerful ML libraries.

## Projects Included

## Task 1: Email Spam Classification
- Built a text classification model using:
  - TF-IDF vectorization
  - Multinomial Naive Bayes
  - Performance evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- Goal: Detect whether an email is spam or not based on its content.

## Task 2: MNIST Digit Recognition
- Developed a CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras to recognize handwritten digits (0–9).
- Implemented:
  - Model training and evaluation on MNIST dataset
  - Real-time digit prediction with OpenCV/Tkinter GUI
 
## Task 3: Housing Price Prediction

Built a regression model using the California Housing dataset to predict house prices.
Implemented:
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Feature selection and scaling
Model training using algorithms like Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor
Model evaluation with R² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Goal: Predict median house values based on features like location, average rooms, and population.

## Task 4: Iris Flower Classification

Developed a classification model using the Iris dataset to classify flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).
Implemented:
Data preprocessing (label encoding, feature scaling)
Multiple ML algorithms: Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Random Forest
Cross-validation and GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
Visualizations: pairplots, heatmaps, confusion matrix, feature importance
Goal: Accurately classify iris flowers based on petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python, NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn
- TensorFlow, Keras
